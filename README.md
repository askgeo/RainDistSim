# Rainfall Distribution Simulator

This script generates 60 years of simulated rainfall data using a gamma distribution for each month. 
A ggplot is included to show the probabiolity distribution functions generated by month on one plot.

This script is a working version of code which is still in development.

# Feature wishlist
